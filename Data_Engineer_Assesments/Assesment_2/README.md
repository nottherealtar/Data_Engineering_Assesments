
# Assessment 2: Solar Energy Data Integration

## Objective

This assessment evaluates your ability to integrate and manage data from various sources related to solar energy production.

## Instructions

1. You will be provided with datasets from different sources (e.g., weather data, solar panel output, energy consumption).
2. Integrate these datasets into a single cohesive dataset based on inverter serial number.
3. Ensure data consistency and handle any discrepancies.
4. (Optional)Create a data model to store the integrated data.

## Deliverables

- Integrated dataset in csv format.
- (Optional)Data model schema.
- A brief report explaining the integration process and challenges faced.

## Example Datasets

- `weather_data.csv`
- `solar_panel_output.csv`
- `energy_consumption.csv`

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the integrated dataset as `integrated_data.csv`.
- (Optional)Submit the data model schema as `data_model.sql` or `data_model.json`.
- (Optional)Submit the report as `report.md`.
